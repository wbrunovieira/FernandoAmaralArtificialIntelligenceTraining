If interest rates increase after you purchase a Treasury security, the market value of the security may decrease. This is because newer securities with higher interest rates become more attractive to investors, causing the value of existing securities with lower rates to decline.\n",

            "3. Reinvestment risk: If you hold a Treasury security that pays interest periodically and interest rates have declined when that security matures, you may have to reinvest the principal at a lower rate. This can reduce the overall return on your investment.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Credit risk: While U.S. Treasury securities are considered among the safest investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, there is still a small risk that the government may default on its obligations. This risk is generally considered very low compared to other investments.\n",

However, during times of market stress or instability, liquidity in the Treasury market can decrease, leading to potential difficulty in selling your securities at a fair price.\n",
